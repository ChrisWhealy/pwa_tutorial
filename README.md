# Progressive Web App Tutorial Exercise

This is the finished exercise from [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja/featured)'s excellent YouTube tutorial series on [developing a Progressive Web App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XT23X0Fjfk).

Due to the age of this course, the coding examples shown in the online exercise and the Git repo no longer function with the latest version of Firebase.
The coding in this repo has been updated to work both with ES6 modules and the latest version of Firebase.
